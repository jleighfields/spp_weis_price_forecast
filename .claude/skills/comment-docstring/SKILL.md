# Comment & Docstring Review

Scan Python files for missing or incomplete documentation. Sweep nearby
READMEs and the active plans for stale prose the changes invalidate. Fix
issues in place and report what was changed.

## Arguments

- **file-or-directory** (required): Path to a `.py` file or directory
  to scan. If a directory, scan all `.py` files recursively.

## What to check

For each function and class:

- **Docstring exists** — every public function needs one
- **Google style** — summary line, Args section, Returns section
- **Type hints** — all parameters and return types annotated
- **Summary is accurate** — matches what the function actually does
- **Parameters documented** — every parameter listed with type and
  description
- **Returns documented** — return type and meaning described
- **An `Examples:` block where the signature leaves the contract open**, and
  nowhere else (see **Examples in docstrings** below)

For the file body:

- **Inline comments** — add comments that explain *why*, not *what*
- **Section headers** — use `# --- Section Name ---` for logical blocks
- **Magic numbers** — explain any hardcoded values
- **Complex logic** — add comments for non-obvious algorithms
- **Self-contained** — no prose that only resolves outside the repo (see
  **Dangling references** below). This is a **fix**, not a note: rewrite
  the sentence around what it was pointing at.
- **Factual** — no rating the reader cannot check: superlatives, invented
  cost figures, personified programs (see **Editorializing** below). Also a
  **fix**: replace the rating with the mechanism it obscures.
- **Terms still name their concept** — no domain term condensed until the
  remainder means something else — "the target" for the day-ahead or real-time
  forecast target is the example (see **Hollowed-out terms** below). A **fix**
  in prose; an identifier that lost its qualifier is reported instead, because
  renaming it changes callers.

## Style rules

Follow the project's CLAUDE.md conventions:

- Google-style docstrings with summary, Args, and Returns
- Use `X | None` syntax (not `Optional[X]`)
- Import modules directly for type hints (no forward references)
- Prioritize simplicity and readability
- Add comments that help someone on-boarding to the project
- Do not prepend function names with `_` — internal helpers still get
  real names

## Example output

```python
def summarize_runs(run_dir: Path, metric: str) -> pl.DataFrame:
    """Collect one metric from every run under a directory.

    Each run writes a ``config.json`` beside its outputs; this pairs the
    two so runs can be compared without reloading the full result set.

    Args:
        run_dir: Directory holding one subdirectory per run.
        metric: Column to extract from each run's metrics table.

    Returns:
        One row per run: ``[run_label, timestamp, <metric>]``, sorted
        oldest first.

    Raises:
        FileNotFoundError: If ``run_dir`` holds no run subdirectories. An
            empty result is far more often a wrong path than a genuine
            "no runs yet", so this fails loudly rather than returning an
            empty frame.
    """
```

## Dangling references

Comments and docs must stand alone for a reader who has the repo and
nothing else — CLAUDE.md's **Comments & docstrings are self-contained**
states the rule; this is how you find and fix violations.

These references usually come from the work that produced the code. Code
written against a plan inherits the plan's vocabulary, and "the Step 4
loader" is clear while the plan is open. A month later, the phrase has no
referent in the repo, and plans are ephemeral by design — superseded,
moved to `plans/completed/`, deleted.

**Grep for the ones with a shape.** Plans, plan steps, tickets, commits, and
the stock "as discussed" / "per review feedback" phrasings all match a
regex. Run this over the target files, including `.py`, `.md`, and marimo
cells:

```bash
grep -rnEi 'plans/|see the plan|step [0-9]|phase [0-9]|sprint [0-9]|as discussed|per (the )?(review|feedback|discussion)|#[0-9]{2,}|(commit|sha) [0-9a-f]{7,}|[0-9a-f]{40}' <paths>
```

**Read for the two classes that have no shape.** The grep cannot find these
and never will — they are ordinary English:

- **The code's own past** — "now reads the IM feed instead of WEIS", "replaces
  the old two-pass approach", "no longer reads the cache".
- **Dates** — "retired 2026-06-03".

A named person slips through as well ("Justin asked for this"), though the
commoner attributions above do match. So **a clean grep means the greppable
classes are clear, not that the file is** — treat it as one pass over a
file you still have to read.

**Point the grep at the files under review, not the whole repo.** Expect most
hits to be legitimate: a docstring saying "step 3" of an algorithm whose
steps are right there is self-contained, and `plans/` is a normal path to
name in a file whose subject *is* the plans directory. Skill, agent, and
plan files number their own steps by design. The test is never the phrase
— it is whether the **referent is in the same file or adjacent context**.

**Fix them** — replace the pointer with the thing it pointed at:

| Instead of | Write |
|---|---|
| "Implements Step 4 of the migration plan." | "Loads the raw extract and normalizes column names." |
| "See `plans/refactor-2026-05-02.md` §3 for why." | "Two passes: the second needs the first's totals." |
| "Changed in #142 to fix the join." | "Joins on `(site_id, date)` — `site_id` alone multiplies rows." |
| "Now reads the IM feed instead of WEIS." | *(delete — the code says which library it uses)* |
| "Per review feedback, retry 3 times." | "Retries 3×; the upstream API 502s under load." |

The last two need extra attention. Prose about what the code *used to be*
requires readers to compare against code they cannot see; delete it rather
than rewriting it. And a rationale attributed to a person or a review
still has a real cause; recover the cause and write that instead of
dropping the sentence.

If you cannot recover what a reference meant, say so in your summary
rather than inventing a rationale — an unsupported "why" misleads the
next reader.

## Editorializing

Prose states what is true and how the reader can check it — CLAUDE.md's
**Prose is professional and factual** states the rule; this is how you find
and fix violations. A rating with no evidence describes the author's
opinion rather than the code's behavior. When the code changes,
unsupported ratings do not update with it.

**Grep for the ones with a shape.** Praise words, personified verbs, and
invented cost figures all match a regex:

```bash
grep -rnEi 'powerful|robust|seamless|blazing|elegant|hacky|nicely|gracefully|beautifully|unfortunately|sadly|nightmare|obviously|easily|of course|amazing|awesome|the (most|least|worst|biggest)( [a-z]+|$)|(worst|best) (way|direction|case)|(happily|cheerfully|politely) [a-z]+s|costs? an? (afternoon|day|week|hour)|!!' <paths>
```

**The trailing `|$` in the superlative branch is load-bearing.** These files
hard-wrap near 76 columns and grep matches one line at a time, so a phrase
split across a wrap — "is the most" ending a line, "common defect" beginning
the next — is invisible without it. Any phrase pattern added here needs the
same treatment or it misses wrapped phrases.

**Read for the classes that have no shape.** The grep cannot find these:

- **Personification not on the word list** — "the two things that bite
  newcomers", "the parser is happy to accept". Any verb that gives a program
  a mood replaces the mechanism with that mood.
- **Filler** — "it is worth saying plainly that", "note that", "it is
  important to understand". What follows is the content; the run-up is not.
- **Aphorisms** — "`utils.py` is where code goes to become unfindable". They
  sound conclusive but state no fact.
- **Effort verdicts naming no duration** — "trivial", "a quick fix", "just a
  rename". The grep reaches only the ones quoting a figure (`costs an
  afternoon`); these are the same claim with the figure left out, and nobody
  measured either.

**Expect legitimate hits, and leave them.** `the most recent` is factual
ordering, not a ranking. This file's own offender list quotes every word in
the pattern, so run it over the files under review rather than the repo, or
this file dominates the output. Do **not** add `clean`, `just`, `simply`,
`perfectly`, `deliberately`, or `quietly` to the pattern — they are
common here and essentially every use is ordinary technical usage (`clean
tree`, `lint clean`, `not just the first`, `simply` meaning "and nothing
more"). Adding them creates a triage pass with no findings.

**Fix them** — replace the rating with the underlying mechanism:

| Instead of | Write |
|---|---|
| "Doc drift is the most common defect." | "Doc drift is invisible to reading — that is why it accumulates." |
| "Fails quietly, in the worst way." | "Fails quietly: the suite stays green and the gate reports success." |
| "Which happily succeeds on a file no parser accepts." | "Which succeeds on a file no parser accepts." |
| "The kind of bug that costs an afternoon." | *(delete — the preceding clause already says what the bug does)* |
| "If a fix feels hacky, find the elegant solution." | "If a change only stops the symptom, find what removes the cause." |

**Try deletion first.** Where the mechanism is already in the next clause, the
rating is the unsupported part and cutting it loses nothing. Where it is
not, the rewrite has to supply the mechanism the rating replaced.

**Argument is not editorializing, and must survive this pass.** A claim that
gives its reason in the same sentence belongs here: "two copies of that
answer would eventually give two" is checkable because it explains the
failure mode. Removing the reasoning from a sentence like that damages the
rule. Ask whether the sentence gives the reader something to check — not
whether it is strongly worded.

## Hollowed-out terms

A domain term shortened until the remainder no longer names the concept.
"Locational marginal price (LMP)" written as "the price" is the shape, and
the failure is hard to spot because `margin` is an ordinary English word:
a reader without the domain can parse the sentence and take the everyday
meaning. A term shortened to an abbreviation is visibly unexplained by
comparison — nobody mistakes "the PRM" for something they already know.

Short forms appear for the same reason dangling references do. After
repeated use, people already in the conversation stop writing the full
term, and everyone knows which margin the short form names. That context
is absent for the next reader, and no marker identifies where it stopped.

**Grep for the terms this repo defines.** A term introduced with a
parenthetical expansion is the greppable half, and it tells you which
multi-word terms matter here rather than guessing:

```bash
grep -rnoEi '[a-z]+( [a-z]+){1,3} \([A-Z]{2,6}\)' <paths> \
  | sed 's/^[^:]*:[0-9]*://' | sort -u
```

Then grep each returned term's head noun standing alone. Expect noise in
both directions: the first pass matches ordinary parentheticals, and a hit
on the second is a candidate rather than a finding — "the margin" is correct
in a sentence that established the term two lines above.

**Read for the ones no file spells out.** A term nobody wrote in full has no
expansion to find. This case needs manual review because a repo where the
short form has fully taken over is also the one where no expansion exists.
The signal is a bare noun that is also common English — margin, capacity,
load, band, window, factor, cap — carrying a meaning specific to this
project. Ask what a reader who has the repo and no domain background would
take it to mean, then whether that is what it means.

**Fix them** — restore the qualifier the term lost:

| Instead of | Write |
|---|---|
| "the price for each hour" | "the locational marginal price (LMP) for each hour" |
| "grows with the horizon" | "grows with the forecast horizon in hours" |
| "scored against the champion" | "scored against the current champion model — the one now serving forecasts for this target" |

**Expand on first use per file, then use the short form.** Every occurrence
expanded adds no new information after the first, and a reader who has met
the term once does not need it again. The first mention — in the module
docstring, or in the docstring of the first function that uses it — is
where the expansion belongs.

**This skill does not rename identifiers.** Where the hollowing reached the
identifiers — a bare `target` where the name means the day-ahead or real-time
forecast target — the repair is a rename, which changes every caller. This
skill edits in place, so renaming would change the API inside a pass nobody
expects to touch it. Name it in your summary and leave it alone;
`/code-quality-review` reports it, where a human decides.

## Examples in docstrings

Google style has an `Examples:` section, and most functions should not have
one. Include an example where the signature leaves the contract open.
Everywhere else it is prose that can drift, with a trap the rest of a
docstring does not have: it looks executable, so readers treat it as
tested.

**Add one when:**

- **The types do not say what is in them.** A parameter or return annotated
  `pl.DataFrame`, `dict`, or a nested container — the annotation names the
  container and nothing about its contents. Show the columns or keys, with
  units.
- **A plausible wrong call exists.** Two parameters of the same type that
  can be swapped, a value in MW where MWh is meant, a ratio that reads as a
  percentage. The example is what rules the wrong reading out.
- **The calling convention is not obvious.** A parameter that only does
  anything when another is set, an ordering requirement, a resource the
  caller is expected to hold open.
- **It is an entry point.** Something callers reach for directly, rather
  than a helper with its one call site a screen away.

**Do not add one when** the signature already says everything, or when the
example would restate the call it documents. `add(a: int, b: int) -> int`
needs no example, and one showing `add(1, 2)` adds no contract information.

**Write it as a real call with real shapes.** Invented column names document
names the code does not produce. Use values the code actually produces,
name the units where a number has any, and show enough of the return to
answer the question the example exists to answer — not the whole frame.

**Run it before leaving it in.** An example is a claim about behaviour, so
CLAUDE.md's *Verify by running* covers it like any other: paste it against
the current code and compare. This is also the reason to keep them scarce.
Each one is a claim someone has to re-check when the function changes, and
an example that has gone stale misleads because it still looks tested.

## README sweep

Every pass under this skill should also sweep nearby READMEs for prose
the diff just invalidated — stale formulas, removed function or column
names, retired flags, outdated tables. No automated check reports most
README drift: the code changes, the doc still describes the old behavior,
and the next developer relies on outdated instructions.

**Which READMEs to check.** The matching-files table under *Project-specific
additions* is the selector — it maps each source directory to the docs a
change there reaches. Where a touched file is not in that table, sweep the
README in its own directory and the one directly above it. Directory READMEs
are orientation notes that point at whatever owns the detail — if a sweep
finds one restating detail that lives elsewhere, cut it down to a pointer
rather than updating both.

**What to look for.** Grep the README set for the name of every removed,
renamed, or refactored symbol in the diff:

- **Removed constants, dicts, or functions** still cited by name.
- **Renamed columns or fields** referenced by their old name in tables
  and bullet lists.
- **Outdated formulas** describing a calculation the code no longer does.
- **Stale config tables** — a field list mirroring a config model drifts
  every time a field is added or removed. Cross-check it against the
  model.

**What not to do.** Do not add dates or "removed in" history. Prose
describes the current state; `git log` carries the history. Write "the
cost path carries no transport term", not "transport was retired on
<date>". Do not add a migration-notes or changelog section to a README to
track a refactor — that belongs in `plans/`.

## Project-specific additions

**Which docs a change reaches**, and they are not all `README.md`:

| Touched file under… | Sweep these docs |
|---|---|
| `src/`, `app.py`, `modal_jobs/`, `notebooks/` | root `README.md` |
| `scripts/` | `scripts/README.md` |
| Anything renaming a feed, an R2/S3 storage prefix, a model name, or the node scope | the active plan(s) under `plans/` |
| Anything changing repo-level architecture, conventions, or where a shared value lives | `CLAUDE.md` and root `README.md` |

- **Match the section-header style already in the file.** `src/` uses
  `#####`-bar headers in some modules and `# --- Section ---` in others.
  Follow what the file already does; converting one style to the other makes
  a diff out of nothing.
- **A comment naming a storage prefix or a feed URL has to say what it is
  for.** "the `WEIS_PREFIX` bucket path" tells a reader nothing they could
  not see; "written here so the hourly job and the backfill agree on one
  location" tells them why moving it breaks something.

## Steps

1. Read the target file(s)
2. For each function/class, check docstring completeness
3. For each function signature, check type hints
4. Scan for places where inline comments would help
5. Find **dangling references** — grep for the classes that have a regex
   shape, read for the two that do not — and rewrite each one around its
   referent
6. Find **editorializing** — grep for the shaped classes, read for the four
   that have no shape — and replace each rating with the mechanism under it
7. Find **hollowed-out terms** — grep the parenthetical definitions, then
   read for the bare common nouns the grep cannot reach — and restore the
   qualifier in prose. List any *identifier* that lost one rather than
   renaming it
8. Add an **`Examples:` block** to each function whose contract its signature
   leaves open, and to no others — then run each example against the current
   code before leaving it in
9. Apply the **README sweep** — use the matching-files table to pick the doc
   set from what the diff touched, then grep it for every removed or renamed
   symbol and fix the prose the change invalidated. A rename that reaches
   `plans/` matters most: an active plan describing a feed by its old name
   sends the next session looking for something that is gone.
10. Make edits directly (don't just report — fix)
11. Report a summary of changes made, including any README updates, any
   reference whose meaning could not be recovered, and any name whose
   qualifier this skill deliberately did not restore

**This skill does not run the test suite**, though its edits are the kind that
can break one — a docstring is inert, but a type hint corrected in passing is
not. Whether the tree still passes is a fact about the tree rather than a
result of this procedure, and its caller establishes it: the `code-reviewer`
agent's full pass runs the suite once after this skill's edits, which is the
run that covers them. **Its `commit` mode does not**, and neither does a
direct invocation. Wherever no run follows, name the suite among what you did
not run, so the summary does not imply the edits were checked.
